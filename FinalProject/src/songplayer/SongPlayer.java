 * This small class was added as a bridge to a more complicated type in an
 * effort to make it easier to use. It also exists so 335 can postpone coverage
 * of concurrency with Threads. It has an interface similar to import
 * javax.swing.Timer in that you create a listener first than call the one
 * method playFile with that listener as the first argument.
