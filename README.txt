**Instructions**
To first get the game running open up the class TRPGUI.java located in the 'view' package using eclipse and run this java file and once everything has loaded a window will pop up.
In this new window there will be three options on the right hand side: 'New Game' 'Continue' and 'Quit'. You will want to click on any part of the words 'New Game'.
After you have clicked on 'New Game' the options will change on the right hand size to the difficulty selection. You will want to click on the word 'Easy' for now. 
Once you have clicked on 'Easy' you will be taken to a new screen that requires you to enter a username for yourself and then enter a number representing how 
many of each unit type you want. There are five units to choose from and you can choose a max of five units. Choosing to have one of each unit by entering a 1
 in each box will work and  you will have one type of each unit, for now it is recommended that you enter the number 5 into the white box under the soldier unit.
Once you have entered a five into the soldier box you may now click on the button at the bottom 'Make team'. This will take you to the map and spawn five soldier 
units for you to control. Along with clicking the 'Make team' button the window will resize itself so you are able to see a bigger portion of the map. At this point you 
may resize the screen to your liking so you are able to see both a good amount of the map and the eclipse console at the same time as both will have important
information. At this point the game is set up and you are almost ready to play but you should read Information for Game Play first.

**Information for Game Play**
Some key info you'll want to know: 
The console will be showing information about what units are being attacked along with where units are moving to.  
There is a tab near the top right hand side of the map, above the how to play button, this tab will display key information about the current players team. 
(meaning if it is player ones turn their units info will be shown and if it is player twos turn their units info will be show)
The map will highlight the currently selected unit with a blue or red outline depending on the team.
The map will also gray out units that have already moved for that turn.
When a new turn starts the players who turn it is will have their units become un-grayed and the other player who is waiting for their turn will have their units grayed. 
The blue team (player 1) starts in the top right hand corner of the map and the red team  (player 2) starts a little bit Northwest of the bottom left hand corner of the map. 
The blue teams goal is to kill all of the zombies or capture one square of the tower they guard before the zombies can kill them.
The red team or the zombies goal is to kill all of the blue teams units without dying or giving up the tower they spawn by. 
To learn the basic commands and how to get units to execute them it is essential you click on the 'How to play' button on the right hand side of the game map.
Turns will automatically end once all units on a team have moved no need to click the end turn button unless you want to end the turn early. 
Each unit currently can either attack, move or wait currently. They cannot do more than one thing in a turn so choose how to approach enemies carefully.
Would also recommend looking at the unit information to know the limits and powers of the two units that will be used for now.

**Unit Information**
Attack: How much damage a unit can do.
Defense: How much protection a unit has from attacks.
Health: Remaining units health
Movement: How far a unit is able to move on the map.

There are only two units that should be used for now. Soldier and zombie.
Soldier:
Attack - 30
Defense - 20
Health - 100
Movement - 6
Attack Range - 3
Item - Attack Boost: Multiplies attack stat by 2

Zombie (Runner):
Attack - 45
Defense - 10
Health - 100
Movement - 8
Attack Range - 1
Item: HP Boost: Not yet implemented

Would also recommend looking at space information to understand how spaces affect you. 

**Space Information**
There are a few types of spaces each affects movement in some way.
Wasteland - no movement affects
water - move hindrance of 5: may not actually hinder movement yet. 
path - increases movement by 1: may not actually affect movement yet.
mountain - move hindrance of 4: should be working
tower - this is what the blue team wants to capture
bridge - no movement affects
walls - cannot walk on them

*Again it will be necessary to click on the how to play button in game and read the instructions in the pop up window, it is possible to leave this window up throughout the game*
